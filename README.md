# React Native Dimensions API Inconsistency on Android

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `Dimensions` API in React Native on Android devices.  The API sometimes returns inconsistent or incorrect screen dimensions, leading to layout problems and unexpected UI behavior.

## Problem

The `Dimensions.get('window')` and `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods may return inaccurate height and/or width values. This is particularly noticeable on different Android devices and versions. This inconsistency can lead to elements being cut off, overlapping, or positioned incorrectly, resulting in a broken user interface.  The problem is often intermittent and difficult to debug due to the unpredictable nature of the inconsistent dimensions.

## Solution

The provided solution explores several strategies to mitigate the issue: 
- Implementing a more robust layout system that adapts to slightly inaccurate dimensions. 
- Using event listeners (`Dimensions.addEventListener`) to re-render components when dimensions change, handling potential inconsistencies more gracefully.
- Using a library that handles layout and dimension calculations more robustly.
- Considering the use of percentage-based layouts, so that the UI is less sensitive to small variations in dimension.

This example shows how to implement the solution by using a combination of approaches. Please adapt it to your specific needs and UI design.
